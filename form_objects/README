Rails Form Objects
--------------------

This project is to try form objects in rails 4.

Steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Signup and signin on localhost.
3. Go to user path (eg: users/1)
4. Click on create new post and fill form.
5. A new post will get created for that user.


Implementation:

- a user has_many posts.
- app/forms/posts_form is a separate form object that takes params of model posts.
- app/views/posts_forms/new uses @posts_form form object to take params
- rest logic is in posts_forms_controller
